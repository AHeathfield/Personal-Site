                        I have always loved art since a young age. I have countless drawing but not all are in my possesion. Most my pieces
                        my teachers throughout the years have asked to keep. I use to copy whatever I saw by eye but I eventually got out of
                        that technique and started doing my own drawings through my own imagination. Here are the pieces of mine that I have found:

                                This is my favourite drawing. There's a whole horror story behind it. Basically someone opens this random door
                                and they get pulled in. A bunch of evil spirits are then released into the world which if you look carefully you can see.

                                This was for a school project. We had to look in a mirror and draw ourselves. If you didn't know I usually have crazy hair,
                                I never really cared about styling it for school so I had alot of trouble drawing the hair.

                                This was for school too, the idea was to take a picture of a scenery you and then go paint it as accurately as possible.
                                I was getting caught up with school so I had to rush the painting leaving out fine details, but I started using the brush
                                more freely because of that and this is probably my best piece of art I've ever made.
