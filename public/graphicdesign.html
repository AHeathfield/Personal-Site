                                This project was extremely tough. I really wanted to test my graphic design skills so I gave myself
                                a task I thought was impossible. I used Adobe Photoshop and I used around 40-60 images in this one piece (get the reference hahaha).
                                I spent many hours on this too, but overall I was extremely happy with the results and I would say this is
                                my best piece.

                                This one was also extremely tough. I wanted to challenge myself like the self composite but this time using Adobe Illustrator mainly.
                                Many layers were used just like the last one, but the real challenge was all the other things I was busy with. It was my second semester
                                of grade 12 and I wanted to get into engineering. McMaster had this option called "Free Choice" which was given to students applying to 
                                engineering degrees if they had +95% average. The courses I had were much tougher at the time too. I had chemistry, computer science, physics,
                                and an iOS app development Co-op that was partnered with Apple. For around basically a whole month, I only got maximum 4 hours of sleep a night.
                                Stressful times that I don't miss hahahaha.

                                This was the first project I did in my communication technologies class that really had me saying I love this course.
                                Before this project I didn't really like working with Adobe software. But this project was so much fun too me and
                                the poster itself didn't turn out too bad. It's my take on the Back to the Future movie with me starring it. At the
                                time when I made this I also started dating my girlfriend. She has made such a difference in my life so when I look
                                back at this piece I also think of her.

                                This was another fun project in my comtech class where we had to mock up a product. I really love the smell of some colognes
                                and I like the way the packaging looked too so I decided to make my own cologne brand. AAH is just my initials and I thought
                                that name would be perfect for a company that makes colognes. I went with a luxurious nature theme. The final picture is a
                                photo I took of the actual mockup I made for it. A technique I learned when making this was making my own colour palletes
                                and gradients.

                                If you haven't noticed the trend yet most these projects were assignments in my comtech class. This one was making a Logo
                                for any company we want (even a made up one) and we can only use 3 cirlces, rectangles, and triangles. If you get technical
                                this one breaks that rule but when I made it in Illustrator I actually only created 3 of each shape (triangle 2 I think).
                                The made up company was for a future space company. There purpose was basically anaylzing data between space transportation,
                                so time of arrival, cost for fuel, any other space data. They would also handle the currency exchange between planets.

                              I find this project funny because it turned out really bad compared to alot of people in the class. I'm not very photo genic
                              but my friend took the picture of me. He somehow took a blurry photo on a $2000 dollar camera which blew my mind but I didn't
                              feel like waiting to use the camera again so I just went with it. When following the tutorial the filters didn't work on me
                              because I was too blurry. And I was too far in to just restart so I said screw the steps did my own thing and I ended looking
                              like one funny looking avatar.

                                This project was done using a technique called rotoscoping. Basically you take a video you find online and you trace out the bodies
                                of people and objects each frame. I did 12 frames per second so it's basically 60 drawings and I also wanted to add some cool effects
                                by focusing on him and adding smoother movement by just drawing lines. At the time I was on the volleyball team and volleyball is one 
                                of my favourite sports which inspired me to make this.

                                This was done using rotoscoping as well, but with my own twist. The scene is from one of my favourite animes One Piece,
                                But I didn't want to just copy the character's drawing. So I made them stickmen and added my own details. This was for the
                                app I was making for my Co-op "Geomatrix" which is a competitive math game. I wanted some attack animation for the prototype,
                                so I made this.
